/**
 * Reconnecting WebSocket primitive shared by the SDK's WS-based realtime
 * helpers (text-stream, session-connect, observer).
 *
 * The platform exposes three workspace-scoped WebSocket surfaces with similar
 * lifecycle requirements:
 *
 *   * Resume on transient drops with exponential backoff + full jitter
 *   * Treat permanent-rejection close codes (1008 / 3003 / 4001 / 4003 /
 *     4004 / 4100 / 4403) as terminal — fail fast, do not loop
 *   * Treat 4029 / 1013 (rate limit / cap) as reconnectable on a slow floor,
 *     surfacing a ``rate_limited`` reconnect reason
 *   * Watchdog the connection: if no message arrives within an idle window,
 *     the upstream is dead even if the TCP socket has not closed; force a
 *     reconnect (with a NON-terminal close code so the loop actually rebuilds)
 *   * Surface every typed message through ``onMessage`` and every state
 *     transition through ``onStateChange``
 *
 * Before this primitive existed, every consumer (developer-console
 * useStreamSession, useCallObserver, agent-engineering scripts) re-implemented
 * the loop with subtle bugs (different idle thresholds, missing retry budget,
 * no terminal-code handling). This module is the single canonical
 * implementation; resource helpers compose it with their own message parsers
 * and protocol details.
 *
 * @see ReconnectingWebSocket
 * @see EventsResource for the analogous SSE-based helper
