/**
 * Account-scoped operations for the authenticated identity.
 *
 * "Me" is the SDK-side mirror of platform-api's ``/v1/me/...``
 * namespace — operations that act on the caller's own account
 * (workspaces they own, profile info, …) rather than on a specific
 * workspace they're inside of.
 *
 * Workspace creation lives here, NOT on ``client.workspaces``. The
 * legacy ``client.workspaces.createSelfService`` (which posted to
 * ``/v1/workspaces/self-service``) was removed in SDK 0.28.0 because
 * the route shape confused URL-parsing consumers — the developer-console
 * BFF proxy treated the literal ``self-service`` as a workspace_id
 * and sent identity a JWT-refresh request scoped to that string,
 * which 4xx'd before the call ever reached platform-api.
 *
 * Even though the underlying call is account-scoped, this resource
 * extends ``WorkspaceScopedResource`` to inherit ``withOptions`` /
 * iteration helpers / scoped-client wiring. The bound
 * ``workspaceId`` is unused for the routes here — typically a
 * placeholder like ``"_account"`` from the AmigoClient construction.
 *
 * **No workspace context is injected into the HTTP request.** The
 * shared ``PlatformFetch`` middleware does not auto-prefix paths or
 * inject ``X-Workspace-Id``-style headers based on the resource's
 * ``workspaceId`` slot — the URL each method writes is the URL that
 * leaves the client. Pinned by ``tests/resources/me.test.ts``'s
 * exact-URL assertion.
